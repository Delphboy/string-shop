## Task
Your task is to develop an Interactive classified adverts website using 
PHP, MySQL, HTML/CSS and JavaScript, which allows users to post and 
manage adverts. You can choose an existing range of products or invent 
your own (e.g. Cars, Books, Holiday homes, Houses Computers, Plants, 
Trainers etc.)

 - Your site must be able to store 1000’s of adverts and you need to 
demonstrate its ability by creating at least 10 adverts. 
 - Site visitors may view adverts and can contact sellers, but can only once 
self-registered as a client and logged in with appropriate security 
such as captcha technology.
 - Information stored about users must include their email address, which 
is used as their username, password, address and mobile number. All 
passwords must be appropriately encrypted.
 - Visitors must be able to search adverts by title, price and at least one 
other appropriate attribute (I.e: size, colour or location as 
appropriate)
 - The site should provide information about each advert including price, 
item photos and other appropriate information.
 - Logged in visitors should be able to add items to a “watch list” and 
it must be possible to view, and edit items in the “watch list”. 
 - You must simulate advert expiry where adverts are archived or removed 
after a certain duration (e.g. 2 weeks after creation). You must 
consider security at every step.

The site should be developed using MySQL to hold all the relevant 
information and the MVC Design Pattern with the Bootstrap CSS framework,
 as demonstrated in the workshops. You are recommended to use the 
 provided workshop template as your start point.
